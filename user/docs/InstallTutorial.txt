Tutorial for installing and configurating the Yii User Management 
Module under a fresh skeleton Application generated by yiic

Installing the User Management Module is very easy due to the
great module System of the Yii Framework and the Installer provided
by the Module. In this Tutorial we will learn how to use the User
Management Module on a fresh created Yii Web Application.

1.) Generate your Webapp:

$ php yii-1.1-dev/framework/yiic webapp testdrive
Create a Web application under '/var/www/testdrive'? [Yes|No] Yes

[...]

Your application has been created successfully under /var/www/testdrive.

2.) Extract the Yii User Management Module under the modules/ directory
of your new Web Application. Replace the _0.2 with the latest Version
available.

$ cd testdrive/protected
$ mkdir modules
$ cd modules
$ wget http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yii-user-management/files/User_Management_Module_0.2.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf User_Management_Module_0.2.tar.bz2

3.) Add the Module to your Application Configuration

$ [youreditor] protected/config/main.php

Add this lines:

'modules' => array(
    'user' => array(
      'debug' => true
    ),

in your Application Configuration

4.) The Yii User Management Module needs a Database Connection to work. You 
now have to setup your SQlite or MySQL Database and insert the connection
URI in your Application configuration, like this:

  'db'=>array(
      'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdrive',
      'emulatePrepare' => true,
      'username' => 'root',
      'password' => '',
      'charset' => 'utf8',
    ),
    
$ mysql -u root localhost    
> CREATE DATABASE `testdrive` ;

5.) To let your Web Application use the Authentification Methods of
the User Management Module, we need to overwrite the default 
Authentification Method in the Application Configuration:

 'components'=>array(
 'User'=>array(
      'class' => 'User',
    ),
    
This tells our Web Application that is should access the Model 'User'
when Yii:app()->User is run. Please note the difference of 'User'
and 'user' here. 'User' represents our ActiveRecord-Model while 'user'
represents the user configuration.

If you want, you can set the loginUrl of the Application to this:

 'user'=>array(
      'allowAutoLogin'=>true,
      'loginUrl' => array('/user/user/login'),
    ),
    
 At the time of this writing you have to copy over the UserIdentity.php
 of the User Module to your Application components directory manually.
 This will be automated in later versions. Do it like this:
 
 $ cp protected/modules/user/components/UserIdentity.php protected/components

6.) Run the User Management Installer in your Web-Browser:

http://localhost/testdrive/index.php/user/install

7.) Now the Installer of the User Management Module should appear.
To the right you can set up alternating Table Names used by the
Module. In most cases this is not needed and you can ignore this 
Settings. If you do change this, be sure to set up the correct table
Names in your Application Configuration, so the User Module can access
them.

Click 'Install Module':

Congratulations, your User management Module Installation Succeded !

8.) Click on "Administrate your Users (use admin/admin)".
Now you are taken to the default Front-End Login-Screen of the User 
Management Module. Log in with the Username admin and Password admin.

9.) Click on the 'update Icon' (the pencil) of your administrator User.
Change the Password to something more safe than 'admin'. Click Save.

10.) Remove the 'debug' => 'true' line from your Application Configuration
so your new data doesn't get overwritten accidentally by the installation
process.

Configuration of your freshly installed User Management Module:

Language:

The Yii-User Management Module uses the language that is set in
the Application Configuration. If you want, you can add a 

'language' => 'de',

in your config/main.php to get German Language strings. French and
Spain are available, but not every string is translated at the time
of this writing.

Role Management:

You can add up new roles in the Role Manager. To check for access
to this roles, you can use this code Snippet everywhere in your
Yii Application. Most likely it will be used in the ACL Filter of
your Controllers:


if(Yii::app()->User->hasRole('role'))
{
 // user is allowed
}
else
{
 // user is not allowed to do this
}


Note, that you can assign several Roles to a user holding your CTRL key
in the Listbox. This will be changed to a two-pane view (like in srbac)
in a later Version.

available Application Configuration Parameters:

 Version number of the Module:
$version = '0.2'; 

 Whether the Module is in Debug mode.
$debug = false; 
  
  Table Names:
$usersTable = "users";
$messagesTable = "messages";
$profileFieldsTable = "profile_fields";
$profileTable = "profiles";
$rolesTable = "roles";
$userRoleTable = "user_has_role";
  
  Should there be installed the demo Data? :
$installDemoData = true;
  
  The Layout used. This is the default Layout of the skeleton App.
  Replace it with the used layout of your Web Application:
$layout = 'column2';
