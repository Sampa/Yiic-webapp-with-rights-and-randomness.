This document will describe how to use a Drop down List in the Registration Form.

Let's assume we have a Table 'states' from which the User should choose.
We first create our database Table like this:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `state` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `state` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
); 

Now, we generate our Model 'State' with it (with yiic or gii, it doesn't matter)

A new profile field called 'state' now can be created. Select the type 'DROPDOWNLIST' as field Type. At the bottom of the profile field creation Page you can find a 'related_field_name' input field. Type the name of the column you want to be displayed in the Registration form. In our example it's 'state'.

Save the new profile Field. If you have done everything correct, a Dropdownlist containing all values of the State-table should be displayed in the Registration Process.

The field name is the indicator for the Database Table. You need to make sure that a CActiveRecord Model is available since Yum relies on it. 

If you have any questions/bug reports/suggestions for this, please email me at thyseus@gmail.com or come to the yum google code issue tracker, thank you
